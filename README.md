-   ### Typography
    -   Two main fonts were chosen for this page: 
        -   **"Berkshire Swash"** for the logo's text and titles throughout the project with **"cursive"** as fallback, giving the page a stylish and regal feel, imitating royal decrees in pirate's times.
        -   **"Merienda"** for the rest of the text, with **"cursive"** as fallback, granting an ink pen look that isn't tiring to read.
